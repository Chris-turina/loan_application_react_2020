# _Cuna Mutual Group Loan Application_
#### _This is a browser-based application for pre-qualifying a potential user for a loan._

#### By _**Chris Turina**_

## Description

_This application will let a user apply for a loan to purchase a car.  The user must enter the Car price, the Car make and model, the users estimated yearly income and also their credit score.  The app will then decide if the user qualifies for the loan by comparing the price of the car with the users income and their credit score.  If the user does not qualify for the loan, a message will be displayed saying they have not qualified and some lorem ipsem to get in-contact with support if they have further questions and they can also not try to apply again.  If the user is approved for the loan then they will be taken to a new Account page when they can start creating a new account._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _git clone the project_
* _run 'npm install'_
* _run 'npm start' to run the app locally_
* _run 'npm run build' to build the project for production_
  _note to setup: working on macOS Catalina you do get an error with npm install_

### Notes

_A few notes with the App:_
_I have never done testing with React so I attempted to learn testing with Jest and React and installed it using Node but did not quite write any tests._
_I was unable to get a `Bad Response` call_
_The create password field is not finished_
_With more Time I would learn how to test with jest more and implement it into the project.  I would add more styling to make the page look more professional. I would refactor the code to try and clean up redundancies.
